description: Mark a DONE harness task as FAILED — the owner's "this wasn't actually done" correction
argument-hint: <TNNN> "<what was actually wrong>"   (or: --undo <TNNN>)
---

The owner wants to mark a completed harness task as **failed** (or undo a previous mark). Arguments:

$ARGUMENTS

## What this is

The autonomous build harness (the "Ralph loop") records every task it finishes as a **success** in
its calibration ledger (`.harness/outcomes.jsonl`). Sometimes a task is marked `done` and passes CI
+ the sampled audit, yet the owner looks at the result and judges it **not actually done**. Left
uncorrected, that false success quietly degrades the harness: it teaches the difficulty tuner that
the cheap model works for that kind of task, and it suppresses how often that category gets
audited — so the same class of bug keeps slipping through.

**Marking a task failed is the correction.** It writes the task into the owner-owned overlay
`.harness/manual-fail.json`, which the loop READS (never writes) to:
1. **Re-count that task as a failure for difficulty tuning** — so future tasks in the same
   `(layer × workType)` cell start at a **stronger model tier**, not the cheap one a false success
   vouched for.
2. **Drop it from the cell's confirmed-audited count** — so the harness **audits that category more
   often** again (a false "audited success" had been pushing the audit rate down).

**It DOES change the task's `status`** — the loop's `reconcile_overlays` (see `loop.sh` and
`designs/manual-fail-signal.md`) promotes a manual-fail entry to `status=failed`, which is
**terminal**: the loop will never re-select or rebuild that task. It does NOT re-open the task for
a rebuild — after marking it failed, either fix the work yourself or author a follow-up task with
`/convert-ideas` (or the add-to-backlog skill).

## How to do it

There is a portable helper script that does the whole thing — write the overlay entry, then
commit + push it `[skip ci]` under the **same repo lock the loop uses** (so it never races the loop's
git operations). It needs no dashboard. Run it from the repo root:

```bash
# Mark a done task failed (a reason is REQUIRED — say what was actually wrong):
.harness/mark-failed.sh <TNNN> "<concise reason>"

# Undo a previous mark:
.harness/mark-failed.sh --undo <TNNN>
```

Steps for you (Claude) to follow:
1. **Parse the arguments** into a task id (`T<digits>`) and a reason (everything after the id), or an
   `--undo <TNNN>` form. If the owner gave a task id but no reason for a (non-undo) mark, ASK them for
   a one-line reason before running — the reason is mandatory and is the record of what was wrong.
2. **Run `.harness/mark-failed.sh`** with those arguments (it validates that the id exists and is a
   `done` task, writes `.harness/manual-fail.json`, and commits + pushes under the lock). If the
   script reports the task isn't `done`, relay that — only recorded successes can be overturned.
3. **Report** what was marked (id + reason), and that it was committed/pushed. Note the effect: the
   task's `(layer × workType)` cell will now be built with a stronger model and audited more often,
   and its `status` will become `failed` (terminal) once the loop's next pass reconciles the overlay
   — the loop will not rebuild it on its own. If they want the work redone, that's a separate fix or
   a new follow-up task.

## Notes

- This is **owner-driven only** — never mark a task failed on your own initiative; only when the
  owner explicitly asks.
- The overlay (`.harness/manual-fail.json`) is **committed** (like `reviews.json`/`human-done.json`),
  on a git path disjoint from everything the loop writes, so it never conflicts with the loop.
- Full design + rationale: `.harness/designs/manual-fail-signal.md`.
