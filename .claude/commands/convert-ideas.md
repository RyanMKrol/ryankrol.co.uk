description: Convert EVERY idea in the inbox into backlog tasks — one agent per idea/cluster, fully parallel, with a single consolidation pass instead of per-agent locking
argument-hint: [optional — a single idea to start with; omit to sweep the whole inbox]
---

Convert ideas from `.harness/IDEAS.md` into well-formed backlog tasks. This is the deliberate Step 2
of the ideas → tasks flow documented in `.harness/CLAUDE.md` § "Ideas inbox & the two-step flow". It
leans on the `ralph-loop-add-to-backlog` schema (task object shape, `## Do`/`## Done when` spec
convention, facets vocabulary) but is NOT that bare skill.

**Model: one agent per idea, or per tightly-related cluster of ideas — fully parallel, no per-agent
locking.** Earlier versions of this skill had every per-idea agent take the shared repo lock itself to
allocate a task id and commit directly to `TASKS.json` — under real concurrent use this caused
task-id collisions, a race where an agent's `IDEAS.md` bullet-removal silently misfired, and forced an
artificial "batch of 4-6" cap purely to keep lock contention manageable. This version removes the
contention by construction instead of just serializing it: **every per-idea agent writes ONLY to its
own uniquely-named scratch file** (no shared resource touched during interview/shaping at all), and a
**single consolidation pass**, run once at the end, allocates every task id, resolves cross-idea
`dependsOn` links, writes `TASKS.json` + spec files, commits, pushes, and cleans up `IDEAS.md` — all in
one locked step instead of one per idea. Because agents no longer contend over anything, **there is no
batch-size cap and no staggering**: launch every independent unit in ONE wave. The only grouping that
still matters is **shared answer-space** — cluster ideas under the SAME agent when answering one idea's
interview question would plausibly change what you'd ask (or how you'd shape) another; see Stage 1.

**Because multiple agents may be asking you things at overlapping times, every question any agent
asks MUST be prefixed with which idea it's about** (a short quoted snippet or title is enough — and if
an agent owns a cluster of several ideas, it must name the SPECIFIC idea within its cluster, not just
the cluster) — this is the one thing that makes concurrent interviews usable instead of confusing.
Bake this into every agent's instructions below; don't skip it.

⚠️ **`AskUserQuestion` is NOT available to Stage 2 agents — it is main-thread/interactive-only.**
Agents launched via the `Agent` tool run as background subagents; they have no way to block on a live
interactive prompt, so a per-unit agent that tries to call `AskUserQuestion` will find it missing from
its tool list (confirmed via `ToolSearch` in practice — don't make agents waste a call rediscovering
this each sweep; the brief below tells them directly). **Questions are relayed through YOU (the main
thread), not asked directly by the subagent.**

**Don't rely on your own conversation memory to carry open questions — that's a dropped-question risk
(long-sweep context pressure, a summarization event, or the session ending mid-relay all lose it).**
An agent with a genuine open question writes it to a **durable file**,
`.harness/.pending-questions/<slug>.json` (schema below), as well as putting it in its final report
text — the file is the authoritative record; the report text is just for your immediate visibility.
This mirrors why completed units write `.harness/.pending-tasks/<slug>.json` instead of you just
remembering their shape: anything that must survive an interruption goes on disk, not in memory.

The actual flow, once every Stage 2 agent reports back:
1. An agent that reached a genuine open question (not something it could reasonably decide itself)
   writes `.harness/.pending-questions/<slug>.json` (see schema in the agent brief below), does NOT
   write its pending-tasks file, and puts the same question(s) in its final report text — still
   prefixed per-idea as above.
2. An agent that could make a confident, low-risk, well-documented judgment call instead of blocking
   (e.g. reusing an existing styling convention already used elsewhere in the same file) SHOULD do
   that and write its pending-tasks file directly, recording the judgment call in its `report` field
   for the owner to override later if needed — don't manufacture a question just because the tool is
   missing.
3. Once you've heard back from every launched unit, run `ls .harness/.pending-questions/*.json` and
   read each file — **this is the authoritative list of open questions, not your recollection of report
   texts.** Collect every question across every file and relay them to the owner via `AskUserQuestion`,
   batching up to 4 questions per call (several calls in sequence if there are more) — keep each
   question's per-idea prefix from the file.
4. For every unit that's still blocked, `SendMessage` its `agentId` with the owner's answers relevant
   to that unit (only that unit's, not everyone else's). **Don't assume the answers fully unblock it** —
   tell the agent explicitly to check: if the answers settle everything, delete its own
   `.harness/.pending-questions/<slug>.json` and finish shaping + write its pending-tasks file; if the
   answers open a genuinely NEW question, it should instead **overwrite**
   `.harness/.pending-questions/<slug>.json` with the new question(s) (same schema, same file — not a
   second file) and report back still-blocked, same as its first round. Loop steps 3-4 again for any
   unit that comes back still-blocked — there's no cap on rounds, only on asking something it could
   have decided itself.
5. Only proceed to Stage 3 once every launched unit has EITHER written a pending-tasks file OR (for a
   genuinely deferred idea — see the interview step below) explicitly confirmed it's writing none, AND
   `.harness/.pending-questions/` is empty — an unexpected leftover file at this point means a unit
   came back still-blocked and got missed in a relay round; check for it before declaring the sweep done.

**Crash/interruption recovery for open questions is Stage 0's job** (see its new step below) — if the
whole sweep dies while units are blocked, the durable `.pending-questions/*.json` files are exactly
what lets a FUTURE sweep pick the thread back up instead of silently losing it.

---

## Stage 0 — recovery check (main thread, serial, before anything else)

Before touching the current inbox, check whether a PREVIOUS sweep was interrupted — this avoids
re-interviewing the owner about work that's already fully decided (or even already committed) because
a prior run never reached its final write.

1. **Leftover pending-task files.** `mkdir -p .harness/.pending-tasks` then
   `ls .harness/.pending-tasks/*.json` (glob may match nothing — that's fine, means no leftovers). Each
   file that exists represents a unit (one idea, or a shared-answer-space cluster) that was FULLY
   interviewed and shaped in a prior run but never consolidated — the run ended before Stage 3 (a
   crash, a Ctrl+C, the owner closing the session) ran. If any exist, **run Stage 3 on them right now**,
   before doing anything else — this flushes the backlog into real tasks so today's sweep starts clean
   and nobody has to re-answer already-settled questions.

2. **Leftover pending-QUESTION files.** `mkdir -p .harness/.pending-questions` then
   `ls .harness/.pending-questions/*.json`. Each file represents a unit that was blocked on a genuine
   open question when a PRIOR sweep ended before the question was ever relayed to the owner (a crash,
   a Ctrl+C, or the session ending mid-relay — see the warning above `## Stage 2`). Don't silently drop
   these — the idea's bullet is still sitting in `IDEAS.md` waiting on an answer nobody gave. For each
   file: read it (schema: `{ agentSlug, ideaBullets, questions, report }`), relay its `questions` to the
   owner via `AskUserQuestion` (same per-idea-prefixed batching as a live sweep), then launch a FRESH
   agent for that unit — you do not need (and should not assume) the original agent is still resumable
   across a new session — seeded with the pending-questions file's full content (idea bullets, what a
   prior agent already worked out, the questions it asked) plus the owner's answers, and instruct it to
   pick up from there: finish shaping, write `.harness/.pending-tasks/<slug>.json`, and delete the old
   `.harness/.pending-questions/<slug>.json`. Once every leftover question file is resolved this way,
   run Stage 3 to flush the resulting pending-tasks files before continuing to Stage 1 — this ensures
   Stage 1 reads an `IDEAS.md` that no longer carries bullets for already-resolved ideas.

3. **Stale `IDEAS.md` bullets for already-converted ideas.** Some interruptions land between "task
   committed" and "bullet removed" (observed live in a real sweep — a task landed cleanly but its
   source bullet stayed in the inbox because the removal step never ran). Before interviewing anyone,
   do a lightweight, fuzzy cross-check: skim `git log --oneline -15` for recent `backlog: add …`
   commits and `.harness/TASKS.json`'s most recent ~10 entries' titles. For any CURRENT inbox bullet
   that plausibly matches one of those — same file/component/feature — surface it to the owner via
   `AskUserQuestion`: *"This bullet looks like it might already be covered by `<task id/title>` —
   already done, or still wanted?"* Only remove the bullet (no new task) if the owner confirms; this
   check is fuzzy and judgment-based, so never silently drop a bullet without asking.

---

## Stage 1 — build the worklist, de-dup, group by shared answer-space (main thread, serial)

Read `.harness/IDEAS.md`'s `## Inbox` (after Stage 0's flush/cleanup). Collect every remaining bullet
into a worklist. If the inbox is empty, say so and stop. If the owner is clearly mid-build on something
else, say so and offer to defer the whole sweep.

**De-dup pass.** Scan the full worklist for ideas that are the same idea or substantially overlap —
SEMANTIC similarity, not exact-text match. Group suspected duplicates and surface each group to the
owner via `AskUserQuestion`: present the overlapping bullets, explain why you think they're the same,
ask whether to merge or drop one. Do NOT auto-merge.

**Grouping pass — replaces the old "relation pass."** Look at the whole remaining worklist for two
distinct kinds of relationship, and treat them differently:

- **Shared answer-space → put them on the SAME agent.** Two (or more) ideas share answer-space when
  the answer to one idea's interview question would plausibly change what you'd ask — or how you'd
  shape — another idea. Concrete signals: both ideas touch the same page/component/file and a design
  choice in one determines what "done" means for the other; the idea text itself cross-references
  another idea explicitly (e.g. "discuss this together with…"); one idea is really a refinement or
  qualification of another's scope. Judgment call — ask yourself "if I answered idea A's questions
  first, would that change any question I'd ask for idea B?" If yes, assign ONE agent the whole
  cluster, to interview end-to-end (it may interleave questions across the cluster's ideas in whatever
  order makes sense, always naming which specific idea a given question is about).
- **Hard dependency, but NO shared answer-space → still SEPARATE agents, launched in the SAME wave.**
  One idea is a foundation the other builds on (needs its eventual task id in `dependsOn`), but the
  dependent's own shaping doesn't depend on the foundation's answers — it just needs a reference to
  resolve later. Thanks to Stage 2's tempId scheme, these no longer need to be staggered: tell both
  agents each other's assigned slug/tempId at launch, and Stage 3's consolidation resolves the real
  link once both are known. Note the pair, but do not delay either agent's launch.
- **Genuinely orthogonal → separate agents, no relationship at all.** Everything else. Do NOT group
  these down for the sake of a smaller batch — there is no lock contention to protect against anymore,
  and conservative batching wastes the owner's time for no benefit.

Whatever remains after de-dup is the set of **agent units** (a unit = one idea, or a shared-answer-space
cluster) that proceeds to Stage 2 — every unit launches together, in one wave.

---

## Stage 2 — parallel per-unit agents (explore → interview loop → shape → OWN scratch file only)

**Launch every agent unit from Stage 1 together, in ONE message (all `Agent` tool calls at once).**
There is no batch cap and no staggering for any reason — including hard-dependency pairs (tell both
agents in that pair the other's slug so they can cross-reference; do not launch one after the other).

**Each per-unit agent gets this brief** (fresh agent, full tool access — it needs `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/
`Bash` for exploration and `Write` for its own scratch file — it does NOT have `AskUserQuestion` (main-
thread-only, see the warning above — tell the agent this directly so it doesn't waste a `ToolSearch`
call finding out), does NOT need `Edit`, and never touches `.harness/TASKS.json`, `.harness/tasks/`,
`.harness/IDEAS.md`, or git):

## Stage 3 — ONE consolidation pass (main thread, after every launched unit reports back)

Once every unit from the current wave has reported done, run **`.harness/consolidate-ideas.sh`** —
a permanent, tested framework script (paired with `.harness/consolidate-ideas.mjs`), not something
to re-derive from pseudocode each sweep:

```bash
bash .harness/consolidate-ideas.sh
```

Run it directly with `bash` — do not `source` it, and do not invoke it under a non-bash interactive
shell (this environment's Bash tool shell is `zsh`; the script's shebang + explicit `bash` invocation
sidesteps that, but don't second-guess it by sourcing `loop.sh` yourself in a raw Bash call).

The script runs under `loop.sh`'s own shared lock (`LOOP_SOURCE_ONLY=1 source loop.sh` — the same
pattern `mark-done.sh`/`mark-failed.sh`/`mark-reviewed.sh` already use to reuse
`acquire_lock`/`release_lock`), not a standalone lock file — this repo has no separate daemon process
that would need to coordinate on the mutex from outside `loop.sh`. One consequence: it EXITS
IMMEDIATELY (no wait/retry) if the loop is currently running, so don't run `/convert-ideas` mid-loop.

**What it does** (id allocation + file writes + one commit — see the header comments in both files
for the full mechanics): re-reads `TASKS.json` fresh under the shared lock and computes the next
sequential id from the current highest; reads every `.harness/.pending-tasks/*.json` file (stable
order) and allocates each task a real id, building a `tempId -> realId` map as it goes; resolves every
task's `dependsOn` (a real existing `Txxx` id passes through unchanged, a `tempId` resolves via the
map, an unresolvable `tempId` — e.g. its unit produced zero tasks — is dropped and reported); writes
`.harness/tasks/TNNN.md` for every task from its `specDo`/`specDoneWhen` (skipped for empty-`tasks`
units); merges the new tasks into `TASKS.json`; removes every consumed idea's bullet from `IDEAS.md`
via **fuzzy match** (normalized: backticks stripped, whitespace collapsed — a pending file's recorded
`ideaBullets` text is a reflowed paragraph, so it won't byte-match the hand-line-wrapped markdown;
exact match would silently fail to remove anything); `git add`s ONLY `TASKS.json` + the new
`tasks/TNNN.md` files (never `-A`/`.`, never stages `IDEAS.md` or `.pending-tasks/`, both gitignored);
commits with an auto-generated message enumerating the new task ids, then pushes (fetch+rebase+retry
on rejection); deletes the consumed pending files.

A unit that was **deliberately deferred** (owner declined mid-interview) writes no pending file at
all, so it's correctly invisible to this pass: no task, no bullet removal, the idea stays in the
inbox untouched for a future sweep.

Read the script's own stdout (it prints a full summary: allocated ids, any dropped `dependsOn`, bullet
match/no-match per unit) — a `no bullet match` warning means a bullet was left in `IDEAS.md` despite
its idea being converted, and needs manual cleanup or a closer look at why the fuzzy match missed it.

Offline / don't want to push yet: `NO_PUSH=1 bash .harness/consolidate-ideas.sh` (commits locally only).

If a straggler unit reports back AFTER you've already run consolidation, just run
`bash .harness/consolidate-ideas.sh` again — it's idempotent, and only ever processes whatever
`.pending-tasks/*.json` files still exist on disk (running it with an empty pending dir is a no-op:
it prints "nothing to consolidate" and exits 0). Stage 0 also invokes this exact script on any
leftover files from a prior interrupted sweep, before Stage 1 even runs.

---

## Stage 4 — final validation + report (main thread)

Do ONE check yourself (not a subagent):

- `jq empty .harness/TASKS.json` — still valid JSON.
- No duplicate ids, every `dependsOn` id exists, no cycles.
- Every buildable task has a `facets` object with values from `facets.json`'s vocabulary; needs-human
  tasks have none.
- Every task's `spec` path has a matching file on disk.
- `.harness/.pending-tasks/` is empty (or contains only units from a wave still in flight, if you're
  checking mid-sweep).
- `.harness/.pending-questions/` is empty (or contains only units genuinely still waiting on an owner
  answer, if you're checking mid-sweep) — a leftover file here after the sweep is declared done means a
  question was never relayed; go relay it rather than leaving it to silently rot until the next sweep's
  Stage 0 happens to find it.
- `.harness/IDEAS.md` — confirm every converted idea's bullet is gone (including "no action needed"
  resolutions) and every un-converted one (dropped in de-dup, or deferred) is still present.

Report a short summary across the whole sweep: each idea → the task id(s) it became (or "no action
needed"), any de-dup merges/drops, any dropped/unresolved cross-idea `dependsOn` the owner should link
manually, and confirmation the inbox and pending-tasks/pending-questions scratch dirs are left
correctly. `.harness/IDEAS.md`, `.harness/.pending-tasks/`, and `.harness/.pending-questions/` are all
gitignored — never commit any of them. Everything else was committed + pushed inside Stage 3's single
consolidation pass, so there's nothing left to commit unless that step reported a failed push (retry it
here if so).

**If the sweep produced ≥1 new task, close your report by suggesting the owner run
`/pre-loop-checkin` before starting an unattended run.** Freshly-authored tasks are exactly
what that check validates (facets present + drawn from the controlled vocabulary, a spec file exists
with non-empty `## Do`/`## Done when` sections, non-empty `scope`) — running it now catches an authoring
slip while it's still fresh, rather than the loop discovering it mid-run. Phrase it as a suggestion, not
a requirement — this command's job ends at a correctly-committed backlog; whether/when to start a run is
the owner's call.
