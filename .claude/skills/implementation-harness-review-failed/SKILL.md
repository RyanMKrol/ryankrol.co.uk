  Use when the user wants to review the harness's failed or blocked backlog tasks and turn what
  went wrong into better-specified follow-up tasks — phrases like "review the failed tasks",
  "why did these tasks fail", "fix the blocked backlog items", "/review-failed". Sweeps every task
  with status "failed" (owner overturned a false success) or "blocked" (the loop gave up), one
  investigation sub-agent per task in parallel, then a single locked consolidation pass that
  authors the follow-ups. Reuses the ideas-pipeline machinery (consolidate-ideas.sh + the
  pending-tasks / pending-questions relay); never touches IDEAS.jsonl. Requires the harness scaffolded.

# Review failed / blocked tasks → better-specified follow-ups

Review backlog tasks the harness could NOT complete and turn each into a **demonstrably better**
follow-up task — never a blind retry of the same spec. Two ways a task lands here, both terminal (the
loop never re-selects or re-opens either on its own, so a human review is the only path back to progress):

- **`status: "failed"`** — the OWNER overturned a false success via `tracking/manual-fail.json` (its
  `reason` field is the owner's own words for why the recorded success was wrong).
- **`status: "blocked"`** — the LOOP itself gave up: an agent-reported blocker, or `MAX_ATTEMPTS`
  exhausted at the top model tier (a `worklog/<id>.md` `failed:blocked` marker + `ledgers/*.jsonl` rows).

This is a **deliberate, human-invoked review** — nothing in the loop's run path ever calls it. You are
the COORDINATOR: you build the worklist and do the final consolidation; you delegate the actual
investigate-and-shape work to one sub-agent per task, running concurrently. It **reuses the exact same
pending-tasks / consolidation machinery as `implementation-harness-convert-ideas`** (each agent writes
only its own `.harness/.pending-tasks/<slug>.json`; `scripts/consolidate-ideas.sh` does the id
allocation, spec writing, `TASKS.json` merge, and single commit+push). It **never touches `IDEAS.jsonl`**.
Read this whole file, then execute in order.

## Stage 0 — recovery check (before anything else)

Exactly like `implementation-harness-convert-ideas`'s pre-flight — a prior sweep may have been
interrupted. `mkdir -p .harness/.pending-tasks .harness/.pending-questions`, then:
- Leftover `.pending-tasks/*.json` are drafts an agent finished shaping. A draft whose DoD is already
  **confirmed** — no sibling `.pending-questions/<slug>.json` with unresolved questions — can go straight
  to Stage 3 (consolidate). Tell the user and offer to consolidate first.
- Leftover `.pending-questions/*.json` mean a review still has questions the owner hasn't answered —
  including the mandatory definition-of-done confirmation (Stage 2 step 4b), so a sibling `.pending-tasks`
  draft must NOT be consolidated until they're resolved. Re-surface them via `AskUserQuestion` (Stage 3's
  format — summarize each review's `ideaSummary` first, then batch its `questions`), fold the answers into
  that follow-up's `.pending-tasks/<slug>.json`, then Stage 3.
- Both empty → proceed.

Also require the harness (`.harness/docs/HARNESS.md`, `scripts/loop.sh`, `tracking/TASKS.json`) and
`jq` + `node` on PATH; if anything is missing, point the user at `implementation-harness:implementation-harness-create`.

## Stage 1 — build the worklist

```bash
jq -r '.tasks[]|select(.status=="failed" or .status=="blocked")|.id' .harness/tracking/TASKS.json
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` names a task id, confirm it is actually `failed` or `blocked` (if not, tell the user
this command only reviews failed/blocked tasks and stop). If the worklist is empty, say so and stop.

**No dedup or clustering pass** (unlike convert-ideas): each failed/blocked task is already a distinct,
unique input with its own history. Two tasks sharing a root cause is rare — an agent that notices it
during its own investigation can flag it in its report for the owner to connect by hand. Every task in
the worklist gets its own review agent, all launched in ONE wave (agents only write their own file, so
there is nothing to contend over).

## Stage 2 — parallel per-task review agents

For each task, launch a **general-purpose** agent (send all the Agent calls in a single message so they
run concurrently). Each agent investigates one task and writes ONLY to its own scratch file — it does
NOT have `AskUserQuestion`, and never touches `tracking/TASKS.json`, `tasks/`, `IDEAS.jsonl`, or git.

**Agent prompt template** (fill in `<TNNN>`, `<STATUS>`, and `<SLUG>` — a short kebab-case tag like
`review-t042`):

> You are reviewing ONE failed/blocked backlog task (id `<TNNN>`, status `<STATUS>`) to understand what
> went wrong and, if warranted, author a better-specified follow-up. Other agents are reviewing OTHER
> tasks concurrently; do only this one.
>
> **1. Gather every piece of evidence — do not guess.**
> - The original task: `jq '.tasks[]|select(.id=="<TNNN>")' .harness/tracking/TASKS.json` (title, scope,
>   facets, dependsOn, gate) and its spec `.harness/tasks/<TNNN>.md` (`## Do` / `## Done when`).
> - **If `status=="failed"`**: read `.harness/tracking/manual-fail.json`'s entry for this id — the
>   `reason` is the owner's words for why the recorded success was wrong. Usually the single most
>   important piece of evidence; take it at face value.
> - **If `status=="blocked"`**: read `.harness/worklog/<TNNN>.md` in full (the `failed:blocked` marker
>   plus everything the builder/auditor narrated across every attempt — usually rich); every
>   `.harness/ledgers/failures.jsonl` row (`jq -c 'select(.id=="<TNNN>")' .harness/ledgers/failures.jsonl`
>   — the full escalation history: what failed at each rung, and whether the causes were the same kind or
>   genuinely different); and the `.harness/ledgers/outcomes.jsonl` row (`topRung` / `totalSoftFails` /
>   terminal `reason`). If `.harness/worklog/<TNNN>.audit.md` exists, read it too (an audit FAIL is a
>   distinct, richer failure mode than a scope/CI failure — understand what the auditor flagged).
> - **Check it's still relevant.** Read the CURRENT state of what the task's `scope` touches, and grep
>   recent `git log` for those paths — has a later task or manual work already fixed the underlying
>   problem? If so, conclude "no follow-up needed" (step 3).
>
> **2. Find the ROOT CAUSE, not just the proximate failure.** A blocked task's proximate cause is often
> mechanical (scope-creep, a needed file missing from `scope`, CI red, attempts exhausted) — the useful
> question is WHY. The most common real cause is **the original `scope` was too narrow for what the
> `## Done when` actually required**. Others: an ambiguous/under-specified spec; a dependency that
> wasn't really ready; or genuine difficulty that needed more escalation than `MAX_ATTEMPTS` allowed. A
> failed task's owner `reason` may point at something subtler — an audit that passed but shouldn't have,
> a `## Done when` met technically but missing the real intent. Your follow-up must be **demonstrably
> better at the specific thing that went wrong** — an identical-spec retry would just fail the same way.
>
> **3. Decide the outcome. You are in the planning stage — bias TOWARD asking.** This review runs with a
> human reachable (via the coordinator's relay); the eventual follow-up gets built by a weaker, unattended
> builder from the spec alone, with no chance to ask. So resolve ambiguity with the owner now rather than
> guessing — whenever a decision changes *what gets built* or *what "done" means*, surface it.
> - **No follow-up needed** (already resolved elsewhere, or a stale/invalid signal — e.g. a framework
>   bug since fixed, not a real defect): write `.harness/.pending-tasks/<SLUG>.json` with
>   `{ "units": [], "ideaBullets": [], "report": "<why nothing further is needed>" }`. No question needed —
>   nothing is being built.
> - **A follow-up IS warranted:** go to step 4 to shape it. You do NOT have `AskUserQuestion` — you relay
>   through the coordinator, and for every follow-up you author you MUST (step 4b) confirm its definition
>   of done with the owner, plus surface any other decision that changes what gets built.
>
> **4. Shape the follow-up — no lock, no git, no `TASKS.json` edit.** Write
> `.harness/.pending-tasks/<SLUG>.json` in this exact shape (the same one
> `implementation-harness-convert-ideas` uses, so the consolidation script reads it unchanged):
> ```json
> {
>   "units": [
>     {
>       "tempId": "<SLUG>-a", "title": "...", "dependsOn": [],
>       "gate": null, "tags": [...], "scope": ["files this unit should touch"],
>       "design": null, "verify": [], "expectsTest": false,
>       "facets": { "layer": "...", "workType": "...", "risk": [] },
>       "visualVerify": true,   // OPTIONAL — set only if the follow-up should be visually verified (see below); omit for auto-covered / non-visual.
>       "specOverview": "Name what this re-attempts and WHY the first attempt didn't land — e.g. 'Re-attempt of <TNNN>, blocked because its scope excluded the client helper the Done-when required.' One or two sentences; this is the task's traceability back to the failure.",
>       "specDo": "The corrected work — incorporate the actual lesson (see below), not a restatement of the original spec.",
>       "specDoneWhen": "The task-specific, runnable acceptance bar. Do NOT restate the universal DoD (format/lint/test/CI-green)."
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```
> Read `.harness/config/facets.json` (`jq '.facets'`) for the controlled facet vocabulary; pick the
> closest `layer`/`workType`/`risk` and never invent a value. Rules specific to a review-derived task:
> - **`specDo` must incorporate the actual lesson**, not restate the original. If the cause was
>   scope-too-narrow, the new `scope` must genuinely cover what `## Done when` needs — verify that
>   yourself by reading the requirements against the scope, don't assume. If the cause was ambiguity,
>   resolve it explicitly in the text. If it was genuine difficulty, consider a smaller, further-atomised task.
> - **Visual verification (facets-driven, same rule as convert-ideas):** a `frontend`-layer (non
>   docs/config/logging) or `style`/`component` follow-up is auto-covered — leave `visualVerify` unset.
>   For a `bugfix`/`feature`/`migration` follow-up on a non-frontend layer, set `"visualVerify": true` if
>   the fix plausibly changes a visual surface (especially if the ORIGINAL miss was visual — an audit
>   that passed on a broken render is exactly the case this catches).
> - **Do NOT set `dependsOn` to the original failed/blocked task** — it's terminal, nothing should wait
>   on it. Traceability lives in the `specOverview` (which names the re-attempt). Atomise into multiple
>   units if the review surfaces more than one separable follow-up.
> - `needs-human` units omit `facets` entirely. Omit `ideaIds` entirely too — a review-derived
>   follow-up has no real idea in `IDEAS.jsonl` to remove; the consolidation script simply does
>   nothing idea-side for a unit set with no `ideaIds` (see Stage 3).
>
> **4b. Confirm the definition of done with the owner (mandatory for every follow-up you author).** Also
> write `.harness/.pending-questions/<SLUG>.json` — the DoD question *confirms* the `specDoneWhen` you
> drafted, so shape the task fully and let the owner adjust it; don't block on it:
> ```json
> { "slug": "<SLUG>", "ideaText": "<TNNN>: <original title>",
>   "ideaSummary": "ONE short plain-language paragraph — what <TNNN> was, the root cause you found, and the follow-up you're proposing; the coordinator shows it to the owner BEFORE the questions so they know which review is being discussed.",
>   "context": "<what you found>",
>   "questions": [
>     { "topic": "definition-of-done", "question": "For the re-attempt of <TNNN>, I'm planning done-when to be: <the acceptance bar you drafted>. Does this match, or should it differ?" },
>     { "topic": "other", "question": "<another decision that changes what's built — include only if real>" }
>   ] }
> ```
> `questions` MUST hold ≥1 entry and ≥1 with `topic: "definition-of-done"`. Hold a unit OUT of your
> pending-tasks file only when it is genuinely un-shapeable until a `topic: "other"` answer lands.
>
> **5. Report back**: the root cause you found, which step-3 outcome you reached, the slug you used, and
> what you wrote (both files). The coordinator reads your files, not your prose.

## Stage 3 — relay questions (summarize each review first), then consolidate

Every authored follow-up left a `.pending-questions/<slug>.json` (Stage 2 step 4b), so this relay runs on
essentially every sweep. Read them all, then **summarize before asking**: first emit a short markdown
recap — one line per review: its `ideaSummary` (and the `<TNNN>` it concerns) — then make ONE
`AskUserQuestion` batching **every** question from **every** file (each may carry several — a
definition-of-done confirmation plus other build-changing decisions), each with a `<TNNN>`-naming
header/label. Fold each answer back to its `(slug, question)`: for a `definition-of-done` answer, update
that follow-up's `.pending-tasks/<slug>.json` `specDoneWhen` if the owner adjusted it (resume the agent
via `SendMessage`, or edit the file yourself), else leave the draft; for a `topic: "other"` answer, fold
it in the same way. If an answer opens a NEW question, **append** it to the same file's `questions` array
and relay again (no cap); delete a `.pending-questions/<slug>.json` only once ALL its questions resolve.

Then run the consolidation (the ONLY step that touches git):

```bash
bash .harness/scripts/consolidate-ideas.sh      # NO_PUSH=1 … to commit locally only
```

It allocates real task ids, resolves `tempId` references, writes each unit's `tasks/TNNN.md` spec,
appends the tasks to `TASKS.json`, and commits + pushes under the repo lock. Since a review-derived
unit set carries no `ideaIds` (Stage 2 step 4), the script's `IDEAS.jsonl` cleanup is simply a no-op
for these units — no warning, nothing to "clean up."

## Stage 4 — validate + report

`jq empty .harness/tracking/TASKS.json`; confirm no duplicate ids, every `dependsOn` id exists, every
buildable new task has `facets` from the vocabulary, and every new task's `spec` path has a matching
file; `.pending-tasks/` / `.pending-questions/` left empty. Summarize each reviewed task → its outcome
(a new follow-up id, "no follow-up needed" + why, or a question relayed + its answer).

**The reviewed tasks stay `status="failed"` / `"blocked"`** — this command never changes that (they're
terminal by design; a new task is how progress resumes, not a reopen). If the sweep produced ≥1 new
task, close by suggesting the user run `/implementation-harness-pre-loop-checkin` before the next
unattended loop run.
