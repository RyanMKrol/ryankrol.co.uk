# supervise.test.sh — hermetic test of supervise.sh's exit-code contract with the loop, via its
# LOOP= stub override (no real loop, no git, no network). The contract this pins:
#   exit 3  → a HUMAN-fixable prerequisite (dirty tree / missing jq / no TASKS.json): supervise
#             STOPS the whole run loudly with exit 3 — never retries on a timer;
#   exit 5  → the loop gave up rate-limited: relaunch after RETRY_INTERVAL (short), not the window;
#   other≠0 → crash/git error: relaunch after SUPERVISE_ERROR_BACKOFF (short);
#   exit 0  → normal cadence; MAX_CYCLES bounds the run.
# A mislabeled exit either buries a human-fixable error in retry noise or idles a healthy run for
# hours — this is load-bearing unattended-operation logic. Run standalone:
#   .harness/scripts/supervise.test.sh
