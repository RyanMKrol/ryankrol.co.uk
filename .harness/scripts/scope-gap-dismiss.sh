# scope-gap-dismiss.sh <task_id> <path> [reason] — record (or refresh) a scope-gap FALSE-POSITIVE
# dismissal so check-task-scope.sh (and therefore pre-loop-checkin) stops re-flagging <path> for
# <task_id> while that task's spec is unchanged. Writes the gitignored per-task scratch file
# .harness/.scope-gap-ignores/<id>.json — never committed. Idempotent: replaces any existing entry
# for the same <path> (so repeated runs don't grow the file). The ONLY writer of these files;
# check-task-scope.sh is the reader (is_dismissed matches on .path + .specHash).
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT (not an inline command in implementation-harness-fix-scope-gaps' step 6):
# the dismissal `reason` is free-form, house-style prose that routinely contains non-ASCII (em dashes).
# Interpolating that into a MULTI-LINE shell command handed to an agent's Bash tool intermittently
# corrupts the shell's parsing of the FOLLOWING lines — every command after the multibyte character
# becomes "command not found" (a real, reproduced failure). Passing the reason as a single positional
# argument to this script, invoked on ONE line, keeps the free text off any multi-line shell program.
# The heavy jq/hash/nested-command-substitution logic lives here, quoted once and correctly.
#
# Field/format/path contract MUST stay in lockstep with check-task-scope.sh (HARNESS_DIR, IGNORES_DIR,
# spec_path=$ROOT/$spec_rel, sha256_of_file, {path,specHash} match). scope-gap-dismiss.test.sh locks
# the round-trip (dismiss → suppressed) so the two can't silently drift.
