# no mocking, no reimplementation. The convergence simulation seeds synthetic ledger rows BETWEEN
# successive real policy.jq calls, exactly mirroring what the loop would write for a real explored
# task, to prove the epsilon-greedy probe actually self-terminates: promotion on success, permanent
# rejection on failure. No git repo / filesystem state needed — everything lives in bash variables.
