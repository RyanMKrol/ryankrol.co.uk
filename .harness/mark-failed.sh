# mark-failed.sh — manually mark a DONE task as FAILED (the owner's "this was not actually done"
# signal), or undo it. This is the PORTABLE interface to the manual-fail overlay
# (.harness/manual-fail.json): it works in ANY project that has this harness, with NO dashboard and
# NO daemon required. (Projects that DO have the dashboard get the same thing via a "Mark failed"
# button, which writes the same file.) See designs/manual-fail-signal.md for the why.
#
# What it does: writes/removes an entry in .harness/manual-fail.json, then commits + pushes it
# `[skip ci]` under the SAME repo lock the loop uses (so it never races the loop's git ops). The
# loop never writes this file; it only READS it to CORRECT calibration — a falsely-recorded success
# is re-counted as a failure for difficulty tuning AND dropped from its (layer×workType) cell's
# confirmed-audited count, so that category gets BUILT WITH A STRONGER MODEL and AUDITED MORE often
# going forward. AND the loop RECONCILES this overlay into the authoritative TASKS.json on its next
# pass: a manual-failed task is set to status=failed — TERMINAL (the loop never builds it; the owner
# fixes the work or authors a follow-up) — see `reconcile_overlays` in loop.sh. This script itself
# still only writes the overlay; the loop is the sole TASKS.json status writer.
#
# Usage:
#   .harness/mark-failed.sh <TNNN> "<reason>"     # mark T<NNN> failed, with a short reason
#   .harness/mark-failed.sh --undo <TNNN>         # clear a previous manual-fail
#   NO_PUSH=1 .harness/mark-failed.sh <TNNN> ...  # write+commit but don't push (offline)
