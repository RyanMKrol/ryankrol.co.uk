# Implementation Harness

> **Customizing?** Put project-specific notes in `custom/README.md` (the overlay — upgrades never touch
> it), not in this plugin-owned file. See `.harness/custom/CLAUDE.md`.

A generic **autonomous implementation harness**: a single, sequential shell loop that builds a
`TASKS.json` backlog **one fully-verified task at a time**, using a fresh-context headless
Claude (`claude -p`) per task, with **all durable memory in the repo**. It's optimised to
**waste as few tokens as possible when a run is interrupted**, and to never mark a task done
until it is *empirically* done — it builds, tests pass, remote CI is green, and (where the
task asks) the thing was observed actually running.

It is language- and project-agnostic. You bring a `TASKS.json` backlog and a CI workflow that
encodes your Definition of Done; the loop does the rest.

> **Full design:** [`docs/HARNESS.md`](./docs/HARNESS.md) is the source of truth for how the
> loop works and why. This README is the quick start.

## The idea in one picture

```
supervise.sh (heartbeat, runs for days)
  └─ loop.sh   ── one task at a time, in its own isolation worktree:
        SELECT  next eligible task from origin/main (deps met, not gated)
        WORK    one `claude -p` builds it, runs the Definition of Done, pushes a branch
        GATE    watch GitHub CI on that branch → green? fast-forward main : fix on resume
        RECORD  refresh the zero-token status board, repeat
```

The conversation is disposable; the repo is the memory. Statuses live in `TASKS.json`,
per-task history in `worklog/TNNN.md`, the work in git. Nothing important lives in a context
window, so every invocation is cheap to (re)start and an interruption is survivable.

## Core principles

1. **Durable state in the repo, not the conversation.**
2. **One task per iteration, fresh context.** No batching.
3. **Sequential, single-flight.** At most one task in motion, so an interruption damages at
   most one task — the core lever for not wasting tokens.
4. **Every attempt is cold.** No attempt reads a prior worklog or resumes partial work — each one
   measures a fresh pass from the spec alone, which is what makes the difficulty auto-tuning and
   audit signals meaningful. An interruption just means the next attempt starts over, cleanly.
5. **The Definition of Done is empirical** — compiled, tested, CI green, behaviour observed.
6. **Determinism where it's cheap; the model only where judgement is needed.** Sync, CI-watch,
   merge, cleanup are plain shell; the model implements, fixes, and judges.
7. **The human stays in control without babysitting** — a heartbeat cadence, a status board,
   and the 🔒 needs-human review gate.

See [`docs/HARNESS.md`](./docs/HARNESS.md) for the full rationale (including why it's
deliberately *not* parallel).

## What's in here

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/loop.sh` | The single sequential loop: select → build → CI-gate → integrate. |
| `scripts/supervise.sh` | Foreground heartbeat that re-runs `loop.sh` on a cadence. |
| `scripts/postflight.sh` | Zero-token, read-only status board (`worklog/STATUS.md`). |
| `scripts/repo-lock.sh` | Shared mkdir-based lock, sourced by the loop and owner CLIs (`mark-*.sh`). |
| `scripts/policy.jq` | Difficulty auto-tuning policy: tier selection + audit sampling. |
| `scripts/mark-done.sh` / `mark-failed.sh` / `mark-reviewed.sh` | Owner CLIs that write the `tracking/` overlays (also what the dashboard's buttons call). |
| `scripts/check-task-scope.sh` | Advisory linter: warns when a task's spec mentions a file outside its declared `scope`. |
| `scripts/consolidate-ideas.sh` / `.mjs` | The locked consolidation pass of the ideas→tasks pipeline — see below. |
| `dashboard/server.js` | Portable, dependency-free backlog viewer (`node dashboard/server.js`) — see below. |
| `config/harness.env` | Optional config: model, effort, caps, CI workflow name. |
| `config/facets.json` | Facet vocabulary + global tier ladder + policy knobs. |
| `docs/HARNESS.md` | Authoritative design of the harness. |
| `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` | The trade-off / limitation log (part of "done"). |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Working conventions every task obeys (branch + self-merge, docs lockstep). |
| `tracking/TASKS.json` | The backlog: schema + example tasks (replace with your own). |
| `tracking/IDEAS.jsonl` | Committed ideas inbox (JSONL: one `{id,title,description,capturedAt}` object per line) — see below. |
| `tracking/human-done.json` / `manual-fail.json` / `reviews.json` | Owner-overlay files — see `docs/designs/manual-fail-signal.md`. |
| `ledgers/outcomes.jsonl` | One terminal row per built task — the sole input to difficulty calibration. |
| `ledgers/failures.jsonl` | One row per failed attempt — diagnostics only, never read by calibration. |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI template — wire your real Definition of Done here. |
| `worklog/` | Per-task append-only memory (`TNNN.md`) + generated scratch. |

## Quick start

1. **Get the files into your repo** — start your project from this one, or copy `scripts/`,
   `config/`, `docs/HARNESS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tracking/TASKS.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
   `.gitignore`, and `worklog/`.
2. **Wire your Definition of Done.** Put your real format/lint/test/build commands into
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml` **and** describe them in [`docs/HARNESS.md`](./docs/HARNESS.md)
   §5 — they must match. CI is the authoritative gate. *(The shipped CI fails on purpose
   until you replace the placeholder steps.)*
3. **Set the knobs** in `config/harness.env` — `MODEL`, `EFFORT`, caps, and `CI_WORKFLOW`
   (must equal the `name:` of your CI workflow).
4. **Write the backlog.** Replace the example tasks in `tracking/TASKS.json` with your own atomic,
   dependency-ordered tasks (schema in `docs/HARNESS.md` §8.1). Mark gated work 🔒 needs-human.
5. **Push `main` to GitHub** so the CI gate has somewhere to run (a remote is required when
   `REQUIRE_CI=1`).
6. **Run it:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   DRY_RUN=1 scripts/loop.sh     # preview the next task the loop would pick
   scripts/loop.sh               # one pass (build the next eligible task)
   scripts/supervise.sh          # leave running for days; re-runs the loop on a cadence
   ```

## Requirements

- **`claude`** CLI (Claude Code), authenticated, with a model that accepts `--model` / `--effort`.
  The loop starts every task at the CHEAPEST configured tier (bias-cheap cold-start floor, set in
  `config/harness.env`) and escalates up the global ladder only on real failure — it does not pin
  an expensive model by default.
- **`gh`** (GitHub CLI), authenticated with `repo` + `workflow` scopes — the loop watches CI
  runs and integrates via push.
- **`git`** with worktree support, and a GitHub remote named `origin` for `main`.
- **`jq`** — the loop and status board parse `TASKS.json` with it (`brew install jq`).
- **`bash`** (the scripts target bash, not POSIX sh).
- **`node`** (any recent version) — only for the optional backlog dashboard (`dashboard/`) and,
  if you use the ideas-to-tasks pipeline, its consolidation script. This is a harness-tooling
  dependency independent of your project's own stack — like `jq`/`gh`, it doesn't need to be
  something your project itself uses.

## Dashboard (optional)

`dashboard/server.js` is a small, dependency-free Node HTTP server (core modules only — no
`npm install`, no build step) with three tabs:

- **Backlog** — the live task buckets (ready / waiting / needs-you / done) with per-task detail (spec,
  worklog, audit log) and buttons that call the same `mark-*.sh` scripts a human would run by hand.
- **Ideas** — `tracking/IDEAS.jsonl` rendered as a one-line-per-idea list (id, title, captured date);
  click a row to expand its full description (rendered markdown), so the inbox is scannable without
  opening the file or wading through every idea's full text at once.
- **Internals** — the harness's own calibration, per `layer × work-type` facet cell: the model/effort it
  would pick and the audit rate the policy will use next (computed by invoking `scripts/policy.jq` exactly
  as the loop does, so the numbers match what the loop actually uses) **alongside the observed audited
  fraction from the ledger**, plus build/failure counts, a failure-kind health panel (which gate is
  actually catching things), the tier ladder, the policy knobs, and a recent-activity feed.

Every tab also carries a live **"Now" strip**: whether the loop is running (from its own repo lock —
including a ⚠ stale-lock warning after an interrupt), the current task/phase/rung/attempt from the loop's
`worklog/.current.json` heartbeat, a collapsible tail of the builder's live output, and a freshness badge
("origin seen Xm ago" / "local ≠ origin") — the dashboard renders LOCAL files, so this surfaces when
nothing has fetched recently. Set `HARNESS_DASHBOARD_FETCH_SECONDS` (harness.env) to have the dashboard
`git fetch` on an interval itself (fetch-only; it never touches the working tree).

The header also carries two ways to tell dashboards apart when you have several open (e.g. multiple
projects, or multiple harness-driven repos): an optional project title — set `.harness/custom/dashboard-title.txt`
(see the customization walkthrough) and it shows next to the gear icon and in the browser tab — and a
background-color picker (🎨, top right) that's a client-only preference saved per-browser via `localStorage`.

It re-reads everything from disk on every request — no daemon; the Internals tab memoises its per-facet
`jq` work on the ledger mtimes so the 5s refresh is cheap.

```sh
node dashboard/server.js                 # binds 127.0.0.1:4790
HARNESS_DASHBOARD_PORT=5000 node dashboard/server.js   # different port
```

## Ideas → tasks pipeline (optional)

A two-step flow for turning raw ideas into backlog tasks without interrupting whatever you're
doing: capture now, convert later, in a batch. `tracking/IDEAS.jsonl` is a committed, zero-ceremony
inbox — one JSON object per line, `{ "id": 1, "title": "...", "description": "...", "capturedAt":
"..." }` — append a row any time (via the `implementation-harness-capture-idea` skill, or by hand;
`id` is the next integer after the highest one currently in the file, local to the current inbox
contents, not a permanent ledger). When you're ready, `implementation-harness-convert-ideas` sweeps
the whole inbox at once: it dedupes related ideas, converts each one (or cluster) in parallel via
its own sub-agent, relays any genuine open question back to you in one batch, then runs
`scripts/consolidate-ideas.sh` — the single locked pass that allocates real task ids, writes each
task's spec, appends to `TASKS.json`, and removes the converted rows.

## Visual verification (optional)

Automated checks can pass while a change still *looks* wrong — a web page, a native/desktop app, a
mobile screen in a simulator, a generated image/chart. Set `VISUAL_VERIFY_HOOK` in
`config/harness.env` to a command that captures the output (a browser screenshot script,
`screencapture`, `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`, a render command, …) and it's injected into the
builder + auditor prompt for tasks that opt in — a per-task `"visualVerify": true` (any platform) or a
`facets.workType` in `VISUAL_VERIFY_WORKTYPES` (default `component style`). Zero cost for every other task,
and zero cost if left empty. See `docs/designs/visual-verification.md` for the rationale and worked
per-platform examples (the old `UI_VERIFY_HOOK` name still works as an alias).

## Gates — what the loop won't do on its own

Set a task's `gate` field in `TASKS.json` to `"needs-human"` to stop autonomous execution:

- **🔒 needs-human** — needs a one-time human step (credentials, provisioning, anything that
  spends real money or touches production). The agent prepares everything around it, records
  `failed:blocked`, and hands off.
- To require a human to **review a deliverable before dependents proceed**, keep the work buildable and
  add a separate `needs-human` review task that `dependsOn` it (dependents then depend on the review).

The loop skips both during selection and surfaces them on the status board under "Needs you".

---

*The name is a nod to the "Ralph" pattern — a dumb outer loop around a smart, fresh-context
worker. The intelligence is in the worker and the verification gate; the loop itself stays
deliberately simple.*
