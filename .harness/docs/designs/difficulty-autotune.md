The harness builds each task with an AI agent at a chosen **difficulty** (which model + reasoning
effort to try first). Instead of a one-shot human/LLM guess, a **self-tuning policy** learns, per
*kind* of task, the cheapest setting that reliably works — saving cost and improving first-try
success, with the human out of the loop.

## The closed loop

> **backlog → loop builds on an escalating ladder → capture each outcome → calibrate by facet →
> policy picks the cheapest-safe starting tier → repeat, getting cheaper + better-calibrated.**

The asymmetry that makes it work: **starting too cheap is self-correcting and self-teaching** (the
task escalates, you recover via the ladder, and you learn the class is harder than thought), while
**starting too expensive is silent waste** (it succeeds, but you never learn a cheaper tier would
have worked). So the policy **biases cheap and leans on the ladder as the safety net** — that saves
money *and* generates the data to keep learning.

## 1. Facets — the vocabulary (`facets.json`)

A **facet** is one labelled, difficulty-predictive axis describing a buildable task:
- **`layer`** (exactly one) — *where* the change lives. **Project-specific**; largely inferable from
  the task's scope file paths. Tailored to the repo at create-harness time; self-evolves (§6).
- **`work-type`** (exactly one) — *what kind* of change (style/docs/bugfix/feature/migration/…).
  **Universal** across projects.
- **`risk`** (zero or more) — danger modifiers (touches-schema, full-stack, …). **Not** part of the
  calibration cell key; instead it clamps the policy's usual cost-saving (below).

The calibration keys on **`layer × work-type`**. `facets.json` is the source of truth (vocabulary +
the global tier ladder + policy knobs). **`needs-human`/gated tasks are carved out** — no facets,
never calibrated.

**`risk` clamps the policy, on top of the `layer × work-type` cell.** A non-empty `risk` on a task:
mandatory audit (the per-cell sampling decay is bypassed entirely — `policy.jq`'s audit mode
returns 1000 per-mille unconditionally), and the eligible starting tier index is clamped to `>= 1`
(never the cheapest rung), even if the cell's historical calibration would otherwise clear the
floor at index 0. This directly implements the intuition that a cell can look statistically safe
while still hiding a kind of failure (a schema migration, a change to the executor) worth always
double-checking regardless of track record. Escalation above that floor on real failure rides the
same ladder as any other task.

## 2. Global difficulty ladder

`facets.json → .tiers.ladder`: one ordered list of `{model, effort}` tiers, cheapest → priciest. The
policy picks a **start tier** per task; escalation walks **up** the ladder (clamped at the top). The
cold-start prior is the `harness.env` `MODEL`/`EFFORT` floor (per-task `model`/`effort` fields are
ignored — facets are the only per-task difficulty signal). `MAX_ATTEMPTS` soft failures per tier before
escalating (default 2 — the ladder is fine-grained).

**Effort-less rungs.** A rung's `effort` may be explicit `null` for a model with no effort parameter
at the API level (e.g. Claude Haiku 4.5 as of this writing) — `run_claude()` omits `--effort` entirely
for such a rung. `policy.jq`'s `tidx()` matches rungs with `.model == $m and .effort == $e`, and jq's
`==` treats `null == null` as `true`, so calibration matches an effort-less rung correctly with no
special-casing — **as long as both sides are real JSON `null`**, not the string `"null"` or `""`. The
loop scripts' ladder parser normalizes null/missing effort to an empty string at read time (`.effort //
""`, so `TIER_TUPLES` stays a clean space-separated pair bash can `read`), then convert that empty
string back to real JSON `null` when writing `startEffort`/`finalEffort` to the ledger. Inserting a new
rung anywhere in the ladder (not just at the ends) is safe for calibration: `tidx()` re-matches fresh by
`(model, effort)` on every run, never against a cached index, so historical rows keep resolving
correctly after the ladder's shape changes — see `docs/HARNESS.md`'s "Bumping the base model" section
for what does and doesn't need touching when the ladder changes.

## 2a. Downward exploration — testing a newly inserted, cheaper rung

**The problem this solves.** `pick_base()` (§4) returns the cheapest tier with `>= minN` samples
and a `>= floor` success rate for the task's cell. A brand-new rung inserted below an
already-calibrated cell has **zero** samples, so it's excluded from that eligible set outright —
not outcompeted, structurally unreachable. It can therefore never accumulate the evidence that
would make it eligible: inserting a cheaper tier-0 rung has **no effect at all** on any cell that
already clears the floor at a pricier tier, forever, even though the whole point of the ladder is
"start cheap." Only escalation (walking **up** on failure) exists without this feature — nothing
walks the ladder **down** to test an unproven, cheaper rung against work that's already calibrated.

**The mechanism.** A bounded, self-terminating epsilon-greedy probe, controlled by
`.policy.exploreProbabilityPM` (per-mille, default `0` = off). Whenever the rung directly below
`$chosen` has fewer than `minN` samples for the task's cell (genuinely untested, not
tested-and-rejected), `policy.jq`'s TIER mode also returns a nonzero sampling probability for that
rung and its index; `loop.sh` rolls against it (the same `rand_pm()` helper already used for audit
sampling) and, on a hit, starts the task there instead of at `$chosen`. The floor for how far down a
probe may reach is clamped identically to `$chosen`'s own risk clamp — a risk-flagged task is never
a vehicle for probing the cheapest rung, exactly as today.

**Self-termination is free.** Once the probed rung reaches `minN` samples, `policy.jq` forces its
probability back to `0` — no separate bookkeeping. If its success rate cleared `floor`, the
**unmodified** tier-selection logic above already promotes it to the new `$chosen` on the very next
call, since it's now the lowest eligible index. If it didn't clear the floor, it's excluded — not
forever, though; see "Periodic recheck" below for how a rejected rung eventually gets another look.
Either way the exploration mechanism's only job is to seed the sample count past `minN` — it hands
off to existing, unmodified logic the moment that's done.

**Periodic recheck (rejected rungs aren't frozen forever).** The currently-*chosen* tier keeps
collecting fresh data on every use and can react to task difficulty drifting over a project's life;
a *rejected* candidate stops accumulating samples the instant `explorePMOut` is forced to `0`, so on
its own it could never notice a codebase maturing enough that it would succeed later. Two separate,
continuously re-evaluated checks close this gap, both scoped to the single candidate rung directly
below `$chosen` (never any other tier):
- **Promote** — a TRAILING WINDOW of exactly the candidate's most recent `minN` touches (never
  blended with older, stale ones — a batch that failed long ago can't drag down a genuinely fresh
  run of successes). Re-checked fresh on *every* call, not on a fixed schedule, so a promotion is
  durable for as long as recent performance holds, and self-corrects — quietly falling back to the
  prior, pricier `$chosen` — the moment it doesn't. No persisted flag, no separate state.
- **Offer** (only reached when not promoted) — whether to sample a new retry right now, gated by
  `.policy.exploreCooldownN` (default `20`) rows of *other* cell activity since the rung's last
  touch — a pure row-count check, no timestamps. To avoid re-arming a full cooldown after every
  single retry (which could take `minN × exploreCooldownN` rows to gather one batch), this is
  computed only at fixed BATCH BOUNDARIES — multiples of `minN` touches, counted from the
  candidate's first-ever touch. Off-boundary (mid-batch), offering continues unthrottled: once
  unlocked, a retry campaign gets a full clean run of up to `minN` trials before the next gate.
- This is distinct from, and complements, ordinary per-task escalation (§ Escalation, unaffected by
  any of this): a struggling task still escalates up the ladder in real time regardless of which
  tier it started on. Escalation failures are exactly the data that can eventually trigger this
  calibration-level fallback — two layers of self-correction, one per-task and one per-cell.
- A recheck-offered retry is untested-under-current-conditions ground, same as any first-time probe
  — it gets the identical mandatory audit treatment described below, never the normal decay.

**Cost is bounded and audited.** A task started via exploration is, by definition, running on
untested ground — `audit_gate()` forces a mandatory audit for it (bypassing the cell's normal
confirmed-success decay), the same treatment a risk-flagged task already gets. The cost of finding
out a newly inserted rung *doesn't* work (yet) is capped at `minN` mandatory audits per cell, per
recheck cycle — not permanently one-time, since the periodic recheck above means a rejected rung
can surface again, but each individual cycle is still bounded and gated `exploreCooldownN` rows
apart, so the audit cost stays proportional to how much the cell's own work actually grows over
time, never a tight, repeated re-test loop.

**Practical note.** Inserting a rung (§2, "Effort-less rungs" paragraph) is calibration-*safe* on
its own — `tidx()` re-matches fresh every run, no ledger migration needed — but that only means the
new rung *won't corrupt* anything. Getting it actually **tried** on cells that are already
calibrated to a pricier tier requires raising `exploreProbabilityPM` above `0` — see
`docs/HARNESS.md`'s "Inserting a new rung" note and the `implementation-harness-update-ladder`
skill, which prompts for this after an insert.

## 3. Capture — the ledger  *(in `loop.sh`)*

`mark_done`/`block_task` append one JSON row per built task to **`outcomes.jsonl`**: facets, scope
size, start + final model/effort, the rung it succeeded at (or blocked), soft-fail counts. **Forward-
only:** only tasks the loop builds reach these, so gated/needs-human tasks write nothing. **The ledger
is the SOLE input to calibration** — the aggregator joins *from* a ledger row to its facets, never
*from* the task list, so re-tagging done tasks can never influence forward decisions.

## 4. Calibration + policy  *(`policy.jq` + `loop.sh`)*

`policy.jq` reads the ledger and, for a task's `(layer × work-type)` cell, returns the **cheapest tier
whose historical first-attempt success rate ≥ floor (default 0.75) with ≥ minN (default 6) samples;
else the `harness.env` `MODEL`/`EFFORT` floor** (cold-start prior). `pick_base` runs it at task selection; the rung
machinery rides the global ladder offset by that base. Robust: any missing facets / empty ledger /
error → the prior, so it can never break the loop.

## 5. Authoring — facets + poor-fit signal  *(add-to-backlog skill)*

The author **describes** the task with facets (from `facets.json`, using scope paths as the layer
signal) and **no longer guesses difficulty** — the policy decides. If no value confidently fits, the
author does **not** invent one (that fragments the calibration) — it records a context-carrying
**poor-fit signal** to `facet-misfits.jsonl` and tags the task with the closest value. Poor-fit is
overwhelmingly a `layer` problem; `work-type` is universal and stable.

## 6. Layer evolution — the poor-fit gate  *(add-to-backlog skill)*

The vocabulary evolves **without a human babysitting it** — the harness is most productive early in a
project, exactly when structure is least defined, so misfits accumulate fastest when the vocabulary is
least mature; the gate self-front-loads, then quiets as things stabilise.

At task-add time, if the accumulated poor-fit count ≥ `policy.poorFitThreshold`, run a **layer
re-evaluation**: (1) an LLM re-clusters the recent backlog + misfits into an updated `layer` set;
(2) it's **surfaced to the human opening with a plain-language paragraph explaining what the harness
does and what they're deciding** (they may not know this machinery exists), then the proposed diff;
(3) on accept, **migrate history** — remap `outcomes.jsonl` facets + re-tag tasks + update
`facets.json` (else changed cells cold-start), then clear the counter (cooldown). The human
approves/nudges/declines; they never do the clustering. This evolves `layer` *values*; new *axes* are
rare and explicit.

## 7. Portability

The faceting *framework* (layer × work-type × risk + ladder + capture + calibration + policy + the
evolution gate) is universal and ships in the harness. Only the **values** differ per project:
`work-type`/`risk` are universal defaults; the **`layer` set is tailored to the repo at
create-harness time** (and self-evolves via §6); the **tier ladder** is set to the project's models.

## Invariant to preserve forever

The calibration aggregates **only from `outcomes.jsonl`** (row → its facets → its cell), never from a
task's status or authored difficulty. That keeps retro-tagged/done tasks and any metadata edit from
ever leaking into difficulty selection.
